# Listen up bozos...

Welcome to Matty's magical video contraption! ü•Åüí•

If you're reading this, it means our beloved drummer Matty has somehow figured out how to use a computer AND create a GitHub repository. Truly a miracle of modern science. We should probably alert the scientific community.

## What the hell is this thing?

This is a live video performance app for remixing the 1927 film Metropolis. Matty built it because apparently hitting things with sticks wasn't enough - now he needs to hit virtual buttons too. The app lets him control film clips with MIDI triggers, because why make music simple when you can overcomplicate it with 100-year-old movies?

## For Jarman (The Bass Player) üé∏

Hey Jarman! Since you spend most of your time holding down the low end and looking confused, here's how to keep track of what Matty's doing without hurting your bass-playing brain:

1. **Click the green "Code" button** - No, not your bass's G string, the GREEN BUTTON on this page
2. **Look for "Commits"** - These are like the musical notes Matty added to his code, except they actually make sense (unlike his drumming)
3. **Check the commit messages** - Matty writes little notes about what he changed. Think of them like setlists, but for nerds
4. **Don't touch anything that says "Branch"** - You already struggle with 4 strings, we don't need you breaking the code too

### Bass Player Translation Guide:
- **"Push"** = Matty uploaded new stuff (like when you finally learn a new riff)
- **"Pull"** = Download the latest version (like pulling your head out of the bass clef)
- **"Merge"** = Combining different versions (something you'll never understand since you only play root notes)

## For Tommy (The Maggot Sandwich Connoisseur) ü•™üêõ

Tommy! Put down that maggot sandwich for a minute and pay attention. Yes, we know you've developed quite the refined palate for decomposing protein, but try to focus:

1. **Watch the "Issues" tab** - This is where we complain about Matty's terrible code (and your questionable lunch choices)
2. **Check "Recent Activity"** - See what Matty's been up to while you've been perfecting your maggot mayo recipe
3. **Look for the green checkmarks** - These mean the code actually works (unlike your digestive system after those sandwiches)
4. **Avoid clicking random things** - We don't want you accidentally ordering more maggots through GitHub

### Tommy's Special Notes:
- If you see red X's, that means something's broken (probably not as broken as your taste buds though)
- The numbers next to commits show how many changes Matty made (count them like maggots in your lunch)
- Don't try to edit anything - stick to what you know best: questionable food choices

## For Everyone: How to Stay Updated

Since none of you know what you're doing (especially Matty, who thinks a "pull request" is asking nicely for his drumsticks back), here's the idiot-proof guide:

### Step 1: Bookmark This Page
Like seriously, bookmark it. Write it on your hand if you have to. Tattoo it on your forehead. Whatever it takes.

### Step 2: Check the "Commits" Section
This shows every time Matty pretended to be a programmer:
- Green = Good (code works)
- Red = Bad (Matty probably tried to code between drum solos)
- Yellow = Maybe? (like Matty's timing, inconsistent)

### Step 3: Read the Commit Messages
Matty writes little notes about what he changed. Sample translations:
- "Fixed bug" = "I have no idea what I'm doing but something works now"
- "Added feature" = "I watched a YouTube tutorial and copied some code"
- "Refactored code" = "I made it look prettier but probably broke something else"

### Step 4: Don't Panic
If you see scary words like "merge conflict" or "failed build", just remember: Matty's a drummer. His idea of version control is having backup drumsticks. We'll figure it out.

## The Current Plan

Matty's building this thing step by step because, let's face it, his attention span is about as long as a drum fill. Here's what he's working on:

1. **Video Matrix System** - A fancy grid where you drag video files (Matty's still figuring out drag and drop)
2. **Cue Points** - Markers in videos so Matty doesn't get lost (like breadcrumbs for drummers)
3. **MIDI Integration** - So Matty can hit his electronic pads and make videos change (because hitting regular drums wasn't enough)
4. **The "Shit It Up" Control** - A chaos button for when things get too perfect (Matty's specialty)

## Warning Signs to Watch For

- **Lots of commits in a short time** = Matty's in a coding frenzy (hide the coffee)
- **Commits at 3 AM** = Matty's discovered energy drinks and programming tutorials
- **Commit messages with lots of swearing** = Normal Tuesday for Matty
- **No commits for days** = Matty remembered he's supposed to practice drums

## Emergency Contacts

If something goes horribly wrong:
1. **Blame Matty** (it's probably his fault anyway)
2. **Check if Tommy's maggot intake affected his judgment**
3. **Ask Jarman to play something other than root notes** (this won't help, but it'll be funny)
4. **Sacrifice a drumstick to the GitHub gods**

## Final Notes

Remember, this is Matty's first real programming project, so expect:
- Lots of mistakes (like his drum solos)
- Weird commit messages (like his song suggestions)
- Random 3 AM "breakthrough" commits (like his late-night practice sessions)
- The occasional working feature (like his actual good drumming, rare but it happens)

Jarman: Try not to get too confused. Stick to bass lines and leave the technology to people who can count past 4.

Tommy: Maybe switch to normal sandwiches for the duration of this project? The maggots might be affecting your ability to understand basic concepts.

Matty: Good luck, buddy. Try not to delete everything. We believe in you! (Not really, but we're being supportive.)

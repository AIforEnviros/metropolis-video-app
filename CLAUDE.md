\## Project Overview

A live video performance application designed for remixing the 1927 film Metropolis in a live band setting. The drummer uses MIDI triggers to control scene transitions and tempo, while the band performs alongside the visuals. The app enables frame-accurate control over film segments with unlimited cue points for seamless live cinema performance.



\## Performance Context

\- \*\*Primary use case\*\*: Live remix performance of 1927 Metropolis film

\- \*\*Key performer\*\*: Drummer controls scene progression via MIDI triggers

\- \*\*Workflow\*\*: Linear progression through film scenes with rhythmic control

\- \*\*Creative goal\*\*: Synchronize live music with classic cinema, allowing musical tempo to drive visual pacing



\## Why This Architecture Makes Sense

\- \*\*Unlimited cue points\*\*: Essential for marking every scene transition, beat, and rhythmic moment in the film

\- \*\*MIDI step-through\*\*: Drummer can advance scenes in time with the music rather than fixed film timing

\- \*\*Tempo control\*\*: Adjust scene playback speed to match live musical performance tempo

\- \*\*Matrix organization\*\*: Different film segments loaded across tabs for different songs/movements

\- \*\*Session persistence\*\*: Save complete show setups with all cue points for recurring performances



\## Core Features



\### Video Matrix System

\- Drag-and-drop interface for loading video files into matrix slots

\- Each matrix slot contains one video with unlimited cue points

\- Individual clip playback controls for each matrix slot

\- Tab-based organization (each song/performance gets its own page)



\### Cue Point System

\- \*\*Unlimited cue points\*\* per video clip

\- Cue points are NOT directly MIDI-mapped

\- Navigation through cue points via dedicated transport controls:

&nbsp; - \*\*STEP FORWARD\*\*: Advances to next cue point (MIDI/keyboard mappable)

&nbsp; - \*\*STEP BACKWARDS\*\*: Cycles through cue points in reverse (MIDI/keyboard mappable)  

&nbsp; - \*\*RESET\*\*: Returns to first cue point of selected clip (MIDI/keyboard mappable)



\### Transport Controls

\- \*\*Global transport buttons\*\*: Play/Pause/Reverse for overall playback control

\- All transport functions must be MIDI and keyboard mappable

\- Individual clip selection and playback within the matrix



\### Output System

\- \*\*Dual screen support\*\*: Send output to separate display for live performance

\- Clean output feed for projection/external displays



\### MIDI Integration

**Native MIDI via Electron (node-midi):**

\- **Direct hardware access:** Native MIDI device communication without Web MIDI API limitations

\- **Lower latency:** Critical for live drumming - sub-10ms response time

\- **Reliable connection:** No browser permission prompts or connection drops

\- **Device enumeration:** Automatically detect and list all connected MIDI controllers

**MIDI Mapping Capabilities:**

\- Everything except individual cue points must be MIDI mappable:
  - Global transport controls (play/pause/reverse)
  - Cue point navigation (forward/back/restart)
  - Clip selection and switching
  - Tab switching
  - Speed control
  - Output window toggle
  - "Shit It Up" control intensity

\- **MIDI Learn mode:** Click any control, trigger MIDI input, auto-map

\- **Save MIDI mappings:** Stored in session files for each show setup

\- **Multiple device support:** Use multiple MIDI controllers simultaneously

\- **Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts:** Alternative to MIDI for all functions

\- **Real-time responsiveness:** Sub-frame accuracy for live performance



\### Special Features

\- \*\*"Shit It Up" control\*\*: A dial/knob that can be "dialed like a motherfucker" 

&nbsp; - Range: 0 to maximum intensity

&nbsp; - Purpose: Add chaos/intensity effects to video output

&nbsp; - Must be MIDI mappable for live performance control



\## Technical Requirements



\### Performance Priorities

\- \*\*Low latency\*\*: Critical for live performance

\- \*\*Stable playback\*\*: No dropped frames during performance

\- \*\*Responsive UI\*\*: Immediate feedback for all user interactions

\- \*\*MIDI reliability\*\*: Consistent MIDI response timing



\### UI Layout Requirements

\- Create annotated UI mockup with numbered sections explaining each area

\- Matrix grid for video slots

\- Transport controls prominently placed

\- Cue point indicators and controls

\- Tab system for multiple pages/songs

\- "Shit It Up" knob prominently featured



\## Development Notes



\### User Experience Goals

\- Designed for live performance environment (dark stages, quick decisions)

\- Jarman's workflow: Each song should have its own dedicated page/tab

\- Intuitive drag-and-drop video loading

\- Visual feedback for all active states and selections



\### Technical Considerations

\- Support common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

\- Handle various video resolutions and frame rates

\- Efficient memory management for multiple loaded videos

\- Smooth scrubbing through cue points



\## Development Guidelines



\### Testing Requirements

\*\*CRITICAL: Test every feature thoroughly before presenting code.\*\* 

\- Verify drag-and-drop actually works with real files

\- Confirm videos actually load and play (not just UI mockups)

\- Test all buttons and controls perform their intended functions

\- Don't just make it look right - make it work right

\- If something doesn't work, debug and fix it before showing the code

\- Test with actual video files, not placeholder content



\### Development Approach

\- \*\*Start simple\*\*: Build one feature at a time, test it completely, then move to the next

\- \*\*Incremental development\*\*: Don't try to build everything at once

\- \*\*Working code over pretty code\*\*: Functionality first, polish later

\- \*\*Real testing\*\*: Use actual video files and user interactions, not simulated behavior



\### Git Workflow Strategy

\*\*IMPROVED WORKFLOW (Starting Step 8):\*\*

\- \*\*Push regularly\*\*: Always push after completing each step to avoid data loss
\- \*\*Smaller commits\*\*: Break each step into 2-4 focused commits instead of one large commit
\- \*\*Commit pattern for each step\*\*:
  1. Add HTML structure changes
  2. Add CSS styling changes
  3. Add JavaScript functionality
  4. Update development plan documentation

\*\*Example commit sequence for a step:\*\*
```bash
git add index.html && git commit -m "Add tab bar HTML structure"
git add index.html && git commit -m "Style tab buttons with active states"
git add script.js && git commit -m "Implement tab switching functionality"
git add Development_plan.md && git commit -m "Mark Step X completed"
git push origin master
```

\*\*Benefits:\*\*
\- Better progress tracking and debugging
\- Easier to revert specific changes
\- Regular remote backup of work
\- More granular code review capability

\### Session Management

\- \*\*End-of-session reminder\*\*: At the end of each working session, ask the user if they would like to push any changes to GitHub to keep the repository updated



\## Current Development Status

**Phase 2: Electron Conversion - IN PROGRESS**

\- Converting validated web prototype to Electron desktop application

## MIDI Implementation Status

**Branch:** `feature/midi-mapping` (ready for testing and refinement)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-12

### Overview

Complete MIDI mapping and MIDI learn functionality has been implemented for all keyboard shortcuts. The system uses native MIDI via Electron with the `@julusian/midi` package (a modern fork of node-midi that works with Electron 28+).

### What Works ✓

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (Commit 9da93c4)**
- ✅ MIDI device detection and enumeration
- ✅ Auto-connect to first available MIDI device on startup
- ✅ MIDI message parsing (Note On/Off, CC, Program Change)
- ✅ IPC communication bridge (main ↔ renderer)
- ✅ Real-time MIDI message forwarding

**Phase 2: Data Structures & Routing (Commit 049b005)**
- ✅ `midiMappings` object parallel to keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ MIDI message listener and routing logic
- ✅ Message matching for Note On, CC, and Program Change
- ✅ Integration with existing action execution
- ✅ Session persistence (save/load MIDI mappings in v1.4 format)

**Phase 3: UI & Learn Workflow (Commit 07b3cd6)**
- ✅ Updated shortcuts modal with 3-column layout (Action | Keyboard | MIDI)
- ✅ MIDI device selector dropdown
- ✅ "Learn MIDI" button per action with visual feedback
- ✅ "Clear" button to remove mappings
- ✅ Color-coded display (green when mapped)
- ✅ MIDI learn mode working properly

**Phase 4: Compatibility Fix (Commit 1f298bb)**
- ✅ Replaced `midi` with `@julusian/midi` for Electron 28 compatibility
- ✅ Successfully rebuilt for Electron
- ✅ No API changes required

### How to Use MIDI Mapping

1. **Open Shortcuts Modal**: Click "Keyboard Shortcuts" button in header
2. **Select MIDI Device**: Choose from dropdown (auto-detects connected devices)
3. **Learn Mapping**: Click "Learn" button next to any action
4. **Press MIDI Key**: Hit a key/pad on your MIDI device
5. **Mapping Saved**: Displays format like "Ch1 Note 60" or "Ch1 CC 14"
6. **Test It**: MIDI device now triggers that action in real-time
7. **Clear Mapping**: Click X button to remove a mapping
8. **Persist**: All mappings save with session files automatically

### Supported MIDI Message Types

- **Note On** - Drum pads, keyboard notes (ignores velocity 0)
- **Control Change (CC)** - Knobs, faders, buttons
- **Program Change** - Bank switching (future expansion)

### All Mappable Actions (17 total)

**Transport Controls:**
- Play/Pause
- Previous Clip
- Next Clip
- Reverse Play

**Cue Point Navigation:**
- Previous Cue Point
- Next Cue Point
- Restart Clip
- Record Cue Point

**Tab Switching:**
- Switch to Tab 1-5

**Speed Presets:**
- Speed 0.5x
- Speed 1x
- Speed 1.5x
- Speed 2x

### Known Issues / TODO

**Testing Required:**
- ⚠️ User reported "MIDI is mapping properly via MIDI learn, but there are still some issues"
- Need to test all 17 actions with actual MIDI device
- Verify no latency/timing issues during live performance
- Test with multiple MIDI devices simultaneously

**Potential Refinements:**
- Consider adding velocity sensitivity for note messages
- Add visual MIDI activity indicator in main UI

- Test MIDI device hotplugging (connect/disconnect while app running)

**Future Enhancements:**
- MIDI mapping for "Shit It Up" control (currently keyboard only)
- MIDI mapping for clip selection (direct clip triggering)
- MIDI mapping for speed slider (continuous CC control)
- MIDI output (send visual cues back to controller with lights)

### Technical Details

**Package:** `@julusian/midi@3.0.2`
- Modern fork of node-midi
- Compatible with Electron 28+
- Native C++ bindings for low-latency MIDI

**Message Format:**
```javascript
{
  type: 'noteon' | 'noteoff' | 'cc' | 'program',
  channel: 1-16,
  data1: 0-127,
  data2: 0-127,
  note: 0-127 (for note messages),
  velocity: 0-127 (for note messages),
  controller: 0-127 (for CC),
  value: 0-127 (for CC)
}
```

**Session File Format (v1.4):**
```json
{
  "version": "1.4",
  "keyboardShortcuts": { ... },
  "midiMappings": {
    "playPause": { "type": "noteon", "channel": 1, "note": 60 },
    "nextCuePoint": { "type": "cc", "channel": 1, "controller": 14 },
    ...
  },

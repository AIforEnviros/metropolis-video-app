## Usage Instructions

When working on each step:

1. **Before starting:** Update step status to "In Progress ⏳"
2. **During development:** Check off testing checklist items as completed
3. **After completion:** Update status to "Completed ✅"
4. **After commit:** Update "Current Step" and "Completed Steps" count
5. **Move to next step:** Update next step status to "In Progress ⏳"

## Notes and Decisions

**UI Layout Issue - Slot Sizing:**
- Currently slots resize when video names are displayed, breaking grid alignment
- Future improvement needed: Fixed-size slots with tooltip/popup for video info
- Consider: hover tooltips, status icons, or abbreviated names that fit in fixed space

**Load Test Video Button Issue:**
- Load Test Video button currently non-functional after global play intent refactor
- File input (Choose File) works perfectly and is sufficient for development
- Can be removed or fixed in future step if needed
- Priority: Low (file input provides all necessary functionality)

### Electron Step 8: Performance Optimization ⏳
**Status:** In Progress - Basic optimization likely already enabled
**What to build:**
- ✅ Direct file:// paths already implemented (no blob URL overhead)
- ✅ Native video codecs automatically used by Electron
- ⚠️ Hardware video acceleration (likely enabled by default, needs verification)
- ⚠️ Memory profiling with multiple large 1080p Metropolis video files
- ⚠️ IPC communication profiling for latency measurement
- ⚠️ Stress testing with all 36 clip slots loaded
- ⚠️ Frame-accurate output window synchronization verification
- ⚠️ MIDI latency measurement (target: <10ms)

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Test smooth video playback at all speeds (0.1x - 10x)
- [ ] Verify no frame drops during clip switching
- [ ] Monitor memory usage over extended performance session
- [ ] Verify output window sync is frame-accurate
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness with 36 videos loaded
- [ ] Measure MIDI input latency with hardware controller
- [ ] Profile with actual Metropolis film segments (1080p MP4/MOV)
- [ ] Test dual-screen setup with projector

**Commit message:** `Optimize Electron performance for live use`

**Notes:**
- Electron provides hardware acceleration by default on most systems
- Direct file access already eliminates web-based performance bottlenecks
- Native MIDI integration already provides low-latency input
- Main focus: real-world performance testing with full Metropolis project

### Electron Step 9: Setup Build and Distribution ⚠️
**Status:** Partially Complete - Icons needed before building
**What was built:**
- ✅ electron-builder configured in package.json for Windows/Mac/Linux
- ✅ Build scripts created: `npm run build`, `build:win`, `build:mac`, `build:linux`
- ✅ Build configuration set (output dir, file inclusions, metadata)
- ✅ Windows target: NSIS installer + portable .exe
- ✅ Mac target: .dmg + .zip
- ✅ Linux target: AppImage + .deb
